# digital access ≠ digital equity  
### a data storytelling project by nasrin ali

this is my final project for the kwk summer 2025 data storytelling challenge.  
i built a scrollytelling site using sveltekit to explore how digital access and opportunity differ between prince george’s county and philadelphia — the two places i call home.

even though my family always had decent internet access, i knew a lot of people in my communities didn’t.  
i wanted to understand why — and how that affects school, jobs, and everyday life.
